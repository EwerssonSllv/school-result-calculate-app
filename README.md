# <h1>Student Average Calculator</h1>

## <h2>Description</h2>

This app calculates the average score of a student based on two grades. If the student's average is 7.0 or higher, and their number of absences is not greater than 10, they are considered approved. Otherwise, the student will be marked as failed.

## <h2>Features</h2>

- Input two grades to calculate the student's average.
- Input the number of absences.
- Automatically checks if the student meets the criteria for approval:
  - An average score of 7.0 or higher.
  - Less than or equal to 10 absences.

## <h2>Usage</h2>

1. Enter the student's two grades.
2. Enter the number of absences.
3. The app will determine whether the student is **approved** or **failed** based on the average score and the number of absences.

### <h3>Approval Criteria</h3>

- Average score ≥ 7.0
- Number of absences ≤ 10

If both conditions are met, the student is **approved**; otherwise, the student is **failed**.
